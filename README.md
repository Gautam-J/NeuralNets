In order to use this website, simply clone the repo and run the server (development).

`git clone https://github.com/Gautam-J/NeuralNets.git`

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python manage.py runserver`

### TODO:
Use Tensorflow.js library to host neural networks instead of running them from a python server.
